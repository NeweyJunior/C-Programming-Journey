# 🚀 My C Programming Journey

Welcome! I am a Freshman Software Engineering student at Ankara University.
This repository documents my progress in learning the C programming language. My goal is to combine my passion for **Formula 1** with software engineering to become a Motorsport Engineer. 🏎️

## 📂 Project Highlights

### 1. 🏎️ F1 Launch Control System (`f1LaunchControl.c`)
A simulation of the Red Bull RB21 launch sequence (Start Procedure).
- **Features:** Engine temperature monitoring, **Anti-Stall System** logic, and RPM-based launch feedback.
- **Concepts:** `If-Else` ladders, `Functions`, `Input Validation`, and state management.

### 2. 🔋 Battery Management System (`BatteryManagementSystem.c`)
A telemetry simulation for an F1 ERS (Energy Recovery System) battery unit. It monitors charge levels and health status.

### 3. ⏱️ Lap Time Calculator (`lapTimeCalculatorV1.0.c`)
An algorithm to calculate and analyze sector times and total lap durations.

### 4. 🛠️ Pit Stop Strategy (`pitStopStrategy.c`)
Basic logic for race strategy calculations and decision making processes.

### 5. 📡 Telemetry Converter (`telemetryConverter.c`)
A utility tool designed to convert race data units (e.g., MPH to KPH, Fahrenheit to Celsius) for data analysis.

### 6. 🧮 Calculator (`calculator.c`)
My first project to understand arithmetic operations and user input in C.

### 7. 🕹️🏎️🔴🔵 Steering Wheel (`f1SteeringWheel.c`)
A console-based simulation of a 2026-spec F1 steering wheel interface.
- **Features:** Implementation of **2026 Regulations** (MOM - Manual Override Mode, Active Aero), Pit Limiter logic with return values, Gearbox memory system, and Battery (ERS) management.
- **Concepts:** `Switch-Case` State Machine, `Infinite Loops` (Real-time polling), Global Variables, and Modular Function Design.

### 8. 🏁🏎 Race Control Panel (`raceControlPanel.c`) 
Description: A modular C simulation mimicking an F1 Race Engineer's control panel. Features real-time telemetry generation (Engine/Tyres), physics-based calculations (Fuel/Downforce), and interactive system monitoring via a CLI loop.

Tech Stack: C, Modular Functions, Physics Logic (math.h), Stochastic Simulation (rand).

### 9. 💻 Telemetry Analysis Program (`lapTimeCalculatorV1.1.c`)
Description: A telemetry analysis program was developed using arrays in the C language (lap time and average speed calculation).

### 10. 💻🧮 F1 Tyre Life and Strategy Simulator (`f1TyreLifeCalculateV1.0.c`)
Description: F1 Tire Life and Strategy Simulator V1.0 calculates tire life based on the track and determine the optimal strategy. The tire life calculation section is implemented in version V1.0, and the strategy determination section will be added in version V1.1.

### 11. 🏎️ 🗂️F1 Telemetry System Using Struct (`f1TelemetrySystemStructs.c`)
Description: A structured data management system designed to handle driver telemetry, tyre compounds, and sector times using C Structures (structs) and Arrays.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am an aspiring software engineer focusing on **Clean Code** and algorithmic logic. I enjoy solving problems related to physics and racing strategies.
