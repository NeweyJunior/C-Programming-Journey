# 🚀 My C Programming Journey

Welcome! I am a Freshman Software Engineering student at Ankara University.
This repository documents my progress in learning the C programming language. My goal is to combine my passion for **Formula 1** with software engineering to become a Motorsport Engineer. 🏎️

## 📂 Project Highlights

### 1. 🏎️ F1 Launch Control System (`f1LaunchControl.c`)
A simulation of the Red Bull RB21 launch sequence (Start Procedure).
- **Features:** Engine temperature monitoring, **Anti-Stall System** logic, and RPM-based launch feedback.
- **Concepts:** `If-Else` ladders, `Functions`, `Input Validation`, and state management.

### 2. 🔋 Battery Management System (`BatteryManagementSystem.c`)
A telemetry simulation for an F1 ERS (Energy Recovery System) battery unit. It monitors charge levels and health status.

### 3. ⏱️ Lap Time Calculator (`lapTimeCalculator.c`)
An algorithm to calculate and analyze sector times and total lap durations.

### 4. 🛠️ Pit Stop Strategy (`pitStopStrategy.c`)
Basic logic for race strategy calculations and decision making processes.

### 5. 📡 Telemetry Converter (`telemetryConverter.c`)
A utility tool designed to convert race data units (e.g., MPH to KPH, Fahrenheit to Celsius) for data analysis.

### 6. 🧮 Calculator (`calculator.c`)
My first project to understand arithmetic operations and user input in C.

### 7. 🕹️🏎️🔴🔵 Steering Wheel (`f1SteeringWheel.c`)
A console-based simulation of a 2026-spec F1 steering wheel interface.
- **Features:** Implementation of **2026 Regulations** (MOM - Manual Override Mode, Active Aero), Pit Limiter logic with return values, Gearbox memory system, and Battery (ERS) management.
- **Concepts:** `Switch-Case` State Machine, `Infinite Loops` (Real-time polling), Global Variables, and Modular Function Design.
